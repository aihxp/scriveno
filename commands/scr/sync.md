# Sync

You are synchronizing Scriveno's installed agent surfaces with the current Scriveno source tree.

This command is for local runtime drift: Codex skills, Codex command mirrors, Claude Code command files, command-directory runtimes, skills runtimes, guided setup assets, and agent prompts that no longer match the source files in the Scriveno package or repo.

This is not a package upgrade command. Do not fetch a newer Scriveno release, do not change npm dependencies, and do not modify manuscript content. If the writer wants a newer published package version, that belongs to a future `/scr:update` command.

The auto-invoke status engine is a shared runtime asset. It is copied for every install target and can be checked with one of these paths:

```bash
scriveno sync --check
scriveno status --project "$PWD" --trigger /scr:sync
scriveno status --project "$PWD" --apply-safe --trigger /scr:sync
node lib/auto-invoke-engine.js --project "$PWD" --trigger /scr:sync
node "$HOME/.scriveno/lib/auto-invoke-engine.js" --project "$PWD" --trigger /scr:sync
node .scriveno/lib/auto-invoke-engine.js --project "$PWD" --trigger /scr:sync
```

Use `scriveno sync --check` for the full read-only sync audit: project status, safe apply, agent availability, and runtime smoke. Use `scriveno status --project "$PWD" --apply-safe` when you only need project routing and safe-helper reporting. Use `bin/install.js` for runtime file synchronization.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js >=20.0.0
- A Scriveno source root with `package.json`, `bin/install.js`, `commands/scr/`, and `agents/`
- At least one target runtime directory, or an explicit `--runtime` / `--detected` choice

If you cannot find a Scriveno source root, stop and explain that `/scr:sync` needs to run from the Scriveno package or repo checkout. Suggest reinstalling with `npx scriveno@latest --detected --global --writer --silent` only when the writer wants the latest published package instead of local source sync.

## Usage

```
/scr:sync
/scr:sync --check
/scr:sync --apply --runtime codex --global --developer
/scr:sync --apply --detected --global --writer
```

## What To Do

1. Locate the Scriveno source root:
   - First, check the current working directory and its parents for `package.json` with `"name": "scriveno"` or legacy `"name": "scriveno-cli"` plus `bin/install.js`.
   - If running from an installed command copy that contains a `scriveno-installed-command` marker, derive the source root from that marker's `source:` path. Older `scriveno-cli-installed-command` markers are accepted as legacy input only.
   - If neither works, stop with the prerequisite message above.
2. Read `package.json` from the source root and report the source version.
3. Detect target runtimes:
   - If `--runtime <key>` is supplied, use that runtime only.
   - If `--detected` is supplied, pass `--detected` to the installer.
   - If no runtime is supplied, detect installed Scriveno surfaces by checking known runtime locations from `bin/install.js`, especially:
     - Codex: `~/.codex/skills/scr-*`, `~/.codex/commands/scr/`, `~/.codex/agents/`
     - Claude Code: `~/.claude/commands/scr-*.md`, `~/.claude/agents/`
     - Cursor: `~/.cursor/commands/scr/`, `~/.cursor/agents/`
     - Gemini CLI: `~/.gemini/commands/scr/`, `~/.gemini/agents/`
     - OpenCode: `~/.config/opencode/commands/scr/`, `~/.config/opencode/agents/`
     - GitHub Copilot: `~/.github/commands/scr/`, `~/.github/agents/`
     - Windsurf: `~/.windsurf/commands/scr/`, `~/.windsurf/agents/`
     - Antigravity: `~/.gemini/antigravity/commands/scr/`, `~/.gemini/antigravity/agents/`
     - Manus Desktop: `~/.manus/skills/scriveno/SKILL.md` plus mirrored `commands/scr/` and `agents/` inside that skill bundle
     - Perplexity Desktop: `~/.scriveno/perplexity/SETUP.md` and `connector-command.txt`
     - Generic skills fallback: `~/.scriveno/skills/SKILL.md` plus mirrored `commands/scr/` and `agents/`
4. Compare source files against installed files:
   - Compare command counts.
   - Compare a representative hash set for `commands/scr/autopilot.md`, `commands/scr/next.md`, `commands/scr/scan.md`, `commands/scr/sync.md`, and all generated Codex `SKILL.md` wrappers when present.
   - Check that Claude Code flat commands include `/scr-*` invocation rewrites and source-marker behavior after reinstall.
   - Check that standard command-directory runtimes preserve nested command paths under their `commands/scr/` directory.
   - Check that skills runtimes include `SKILL.md`, mirrored commands, and mirrored agent prompts inside their skill bundle.
   - Check that installed Codex commands include current response-contract and source-marker behavior after reinstall.
   - Report each runtime as `current`, `stale`, `missing`, or `unknown`.
5. Decide mode:
   - `--check`: report only. Run `scriveno sync --check` when available. Do not write files.
   - `--apply`: run the installer.
   - No flag: if stale installed Scriveno-owned files are detected, ask the writer before applying. If everything is current, report that no sync is needed.
6. When applying, run from the source root:

```
node bin/install.js --runtime <key> --global --writer --silent
```

Adjust flags from the command arguments:
   - Use `--detected` instead of `--runtime <key>` when requested.
   - Use `--project` instead of `--global` when requested.
   - Use `--developer` instead of `--writer` when requested.

7. After applying, verify:
   - Re-read installed command counts.
   - Confirm `sync.md` is installed for each target runtime.
   - For Claude Code, confirm `scr-sync.md` exists and installed agent prompts are present in the chosen `agents/` directory.
   - For standard command-directory runtimes, confirm `commands/scr/sync.md` and installed agent prompts are present.
   - For skills runtimes, confirm `SKILL.md`, `commands/scr/sync.md`, and bundled agent prompts are present.
   - For Perplexity Desktop, confirm the setup guide and connector recipe are present.
   - For Codex, confirm both `~/.codex/commands/scr/sync.md` and `~/.codex/skills/scr-sync/SKILL.md` exist in the chosen scope.
   - For Codex, confirm installed Scriveno agents have matching `.toml` metadata files in the chosen `agents/` directory when the Codex runtime supports agent metadata.
   - Confirm no stale runtime files remain in the checked target set.
8. Report a compact sync status trail:
   - Source version
   - Runtime targets checked
   - Runtime targets updated
   - Any skipped targets and why
   - Trigger: `check`, `apply`, or `prompted apply`
   - Agent: `none` for this command
   - Engine: `bin/install.js` when applying, or `hash/count comparison` when checking only
   - Local operations: command files compared, Claude flat commands checked, standard command directories checked, skills manifests checked, guided setup assets checked, agent prompts checked, Codex skills checked, Codex command mirrors checked, Codex agent metadata checked when applicable
   - Result counts: commands, skills, agent prompts, metadata files, stale files removed, and skipped targets
   - Suggested project-level follow-up with `/scr:scan`

Use this report shape:

```text
Sync status:
Trigger: /scr:sync --apply --detected --global --developer
Agent: none
Why: runtime sync is installer-driven, not a writing or review agent task
Engine: bin/install.js
Checked:
- commands: 112 source, 112 installed
- Claude Code flat commands: 112 installed
- standard command directories: current
- skills manifests: current
- guided setup assets: current
- Codex skills: 112 installed
- agent prompts: 6 installed
- Codex agent metadata: 6 installed
Updated:
- Claude Code command files
- standard command directories
- skills manifests
- guided setup assets
- Codex command mirrors
- Codex skills
- Codex agent prompts
- Codex agent metadata
Skipped:
- none
```

If no files were changed, keep the same shape and set `Updated: none`. If an agent was not spawned, always say `Agent: none` and explain why.

## Safety Rules

- Only overwrite Scriveno-owned installed runtime files.
- Do not edit `.manuscript/` files.
- Do not run `npm install`, `npm update`, `npm version`, `npm publish`, `git pull`, or any network command.
- Do not delete non-Scriveno files from runtime directories.
- Do not claim a runtime is current unless command counts and key files were checked.
- If an installed runtime has user-modified Scriveno files without an installer marker, report it and ask before replacing them.

## Response Contract

Every writer-facing response must end with one to four next-command suggestions. Each suggestion must include a short explanation of what that path will do.

Use this format:

```markdown
Next commands:
- `/scr:...`: One short sentence explaining what this path will do.
- `/scr:...`: One short sentence explaining what this alternate path will do.
```

If exactly one path is clearly best, provide one suggestion. If two, three, or four useful paths exist, show them as alternatives. Do not force a linear path when the writer has a real choice.

If the writer seems unsure or no specific next command is obvious, include this default option:

```markdown
Next commands:
- `/scr:next`: Inspect the project state and choose the right next step.
```

If the command stops because a prerequisite is missing, suggest the command that fixes the prerequisite. Keep every explanation practical and writer-facing.

## Tone

Clear and operational. This command is maintenance, so keep the report compact and avoid manuscript-writing language.
